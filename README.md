# GCP Data Engineering Mini Projects üöÄ

Welcome to my Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Data Engineering portfolio. These are small, focused projects created during my free trial period on GCP to showcase hands-on experience with key data engineering tools and services like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Cloud Composer (Airflow), Dataflow, and more.

> üîß Built with a focus on practical pipeline patterns ‚Äî from batch ingestion to streaming, scheduling, and transformation.
